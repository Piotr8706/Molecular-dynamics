This project is focused on using data from molecular dynamics simulations aquired during my work in Acedemia and published in https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/22/12360
## Abstract
An essential tool for characterizing intermolecular forces and their structural consequences is molecular dynamics. Albumin is one of the significant components in synovial
fluid. Its electrostatic properties, including the ability to form molecular complexes, are closely
related to pH, solvation, and the presence of ions. In the context of synovial fluid, describing the possible interactions between albumin and hyaluronate is relevant, considering solution
composition effects. This study examined the influence of Na+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ ions on human serum
albuminâ€“hyaluronan interactions using molecular dynamics tools. It was established
that divalent cations, especially Ca2+, contribute mostly to the increase of
the affinity between hyaluronan and albumin, which is associated with charge compensation in
negatively charged hyaluronan and albumin. Furthermore, the most probable binding sites were
structurally and energetically characterized. The indicated moieties exhibit a locally positive charge, enabling hyaluronate binding (direct and water-mediated).
