## Abstract
Molecular dynamics is a crucial technique for understanding the dynamics of intermolecular forces and their resulting structural implications. Albumin is a crucial molecule in many biological systems. Its electrostatic attributes, pivotal for forming molecular complexes, are intricately linked to factors such as pH variations, solvation, and the presence of ions. Particularly within the synovial fluid, exploring the potential interactions between albumin and hyaluronate becomes pertinent, considering the impacts of solution composition.

This investigation focused on exploring how Na+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ ions influence interactions between human serum albumin and hyaluronan through molecular dynamics simulations. The findings revealed that divalent cations, notably Ca2+, predominantly enhance the affinity between hyaluronan and albumin. This enhancement is attributed to charge compensation mechanisms within negatively charged hyaluronan and albumin. Additionally, the study delved into characterizing the most probable binding sites structurally and energetically. These identified regions exhibit local positive charges, facilitating hyaluronate binding through direct and water-mediated interactions.
